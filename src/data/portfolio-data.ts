Using transport network modelling and GIS-based analysis, it quantifies changes in travel times and identifies which areas gained or lost access to employment opportunities, highlighting the uneven benefits of major infrastructure investments.',

The analysis highlights the growing dominance of social media virality over traditional curation in driving modern pop popularity.',

      year: '2025',
      description: 'In London, where the majority of employment opportunities are concentrated in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the public transport system plays a key role in connecting people to these jobs. With the opening of the Elizabeth Line in May 2022, parts of East and West London have seen improved travel times to these employment hubs. In this paper, we compare spatial accessibility to employment opportunities before and after this change and assess the spatial equity effects. Using the r5r package for R, we calculate a gravity-based opportunity metric based on public transport travel times. We subsequently evaluate the spatial equity of changes in job accessibility by profiling areas against socio- economic and socio-demographic characteristics, specifically socio-economic deprivation, share of households with access to a private vehicle, proportion of BAME residents, and unemployment rate structure.',
